# MXC Stable Coin (draft)

MXC will be the largest Layer-2 IoT solution on both Dotsama and Ethereum ecosystem, bringing tremendous real-world items to NFT world and data to the blockchain. Undoubtedly each real-world item and each piece of data has its own value, and this kind of value is not from pure financial speculations, the value comes from real economy that serves our food, sports, transportation every day. 

MXC is going to leverage the real-world economy to build the first stable coin backed by items like Gin, Bike sensors, Nike shoes etc. Along with the tokens created on DataHighway like Ride token, Park token and MXC, DHX, BTC, the MXC stable coin has a basket ranging from NFT to tokens to back the stable coin from the real-world economy.

As figure 1 shows, the IoT tokens like Ride token would be the major applications that use MXC network and DHX blockchain to build their own data economy. These Ride and Park token can be swapped in MXC Swap conveniently, through xUSD trading pair. xUSD will be the first IoT stable coin that are backed by real-world assets and data values, meanwhile serving for the digital and real-world economy.

MXProtocol design and DataHighway blockchain both are aimed for validating the xUSD stable coin is pegged to US dollars in 1:1 manner. Along with the NFC, LoraWAN and Satellite technologies, users are able to verify and validate the value of xUSD are backed by collateral like Gin 1689 NFTs, and MXC/DHX/Ride tokens.

NFTs and tokens are used as collateral to back the xUSD, the collateral rate should be above 120% to make sure the xUSD can't be de-pegged from the market fluctuation. Normally the NFTs are issued by companies and manufacturers to let communities to burn xUSD and get a collateral to redeem, in the whole reserve of the MXC there are 20 percent of cryptocurrencies as collateral, the rest of 80% should be IoT NFTs that are backed by real-world assets.

The ratio of the 20/80 percent should be adjusted by MXC Reserve, namely MXC DAO in referendum : https://snapshot.org/#/mxcpop.eth

In the following example, it shows how xUSD is backed:

| Collateral   | Value USD | Quantity | Total USD | Percentage |
|--------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| M2Pro NFT    | 2700      | 10       | 27000     | 72%        |
| Gin 1689 NFT | 100       | 30       | 3000      | 8%         |
| MXC token    | 1         | 2000     | 2000      | 5.3%       |
| Ride token   | 2         | 100      | 200       | 0.6%       |
| BTC          | 5000      | 1        | 5000      | 13.3%      |
| DHX token    | 100       | 3        | 300       | 0.8%       |
|              |           |          | 37500     | 100%       |

This collateral can create **31,250 USD** with 120% collateral rate. When people want to redeem let's say 200 USD ride token, they will also have to reduce the amount of NFT value according to the 20/80 ratio, otherwise the burning of xUSD won't be successful.

In this case, the users will try to redeem one Gin 1689 NFT to get 100USD worth of NFT, and also to get 25USD of any token, like 25USD MXC token. So the user needs to burn 125 xUSD, in return he gets 1 Gin 1689 and 25USD MXC

| Collateral redeemed | Value USD | Quantity | Total Burnt xUSD | Percentage |
|---------------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Gin 1689 NFT        | 100       | 1        | 100       | 80%        |
| MXC token           | 1         | 25       | 25       | 20%        |
|                     |           |          | 125       | 100%       |




## Insurance
The goal of xUSD and MXC, DHX is to enable every person/company to create xUSD and circulate in their own economy to support their business logic, eventually it is to change the current situation that all the stable coins and Fiat currencies are backed by US treasury bonds, while US treasury bonds are like 30 trillion USD and US treasury and Fed Reserve only got 4 trillion gold or other reserves.

We need to peg this world better with the assets created by people and used by people. Also we need to deal with systematic risks if the de-peg happens. Central banks proposes to print more money to solve the problem. MXC DAO proposes that we should add a 10% insurance on the top of the every xUSD mint to deal with the systematic risks.

This 10% insurance can be paid every year to make sure even if the depeg happened like the collateral is gone or the overall overall collateral price is reduced due to a certain black swan event.

The insurance should be an option at the end of the minting process.

## UxT

When the xUSD economy is getting bigger and bigger, the MXC DAO should consider to cancel the 1:1 exchange rate between USD and xUSD, and also change the name of xUSD to UxT as the exchange rate won't be 1:1. 

This is due to the volatility of the Fed Reserve to create more balance sheet and run-off the balance sheet without any anchor, xUSD holder should aim for a certain development that the unit price of the collateral like watch, shoes, wines are defined by the unit of a UxT and no longer will be a USD.

Also the majority of DEX trading pair would be UxT trading pair will define the new stable coin economy.


## Lending protocol
It is expected that people will borrow xUSD and lend xUSD to generate stable APY, there are a lot of similar lending protocols like AAVE will move to DataHighway parachain to enable xUSD economy active.
