# MXC Stable Coin

MXC will be the largest Layer-2 IoT solution on both Dotsama and Ethereum ecosystem, bringing tremendous real-world items to NFT world and data to the blockchain. Undoubtedly each real-world item and each piece of data has its own value, and this kind of value is not from pure financial speculations, the value comes from real economy that serves our food, sports, transportation every day. 

MXC is going to leverage the real-world economy to build the first stable coin backed by items like Gin, Bike sensors, Nike shoes etc. Along with the tokens created on DataHighway like Ride token, Park token and MXC, DHX, BTC, the MXC stable coin has a basket ranging from NFT to tokens to back the stable coin from the real-world economy.

As figure 1 shows, the IoT tokens like Ride token would be the major applications that use MXC network and DHX blockchain to build their own data economy. These Ride and Park token can be swapped in MXC Swap conveniently, through USDX trading pair. USDX will be the first IoT stable coin that are backed by real-world assets and data values, meanwhile serving for the digital and real-world economy.

MXProtocol design and DataHighway blockchain both are aimed for validating the USDX stable coin is pegged to US dollars in 1:1 manner. Along with the NFC, LoraWAN and Satellite technologies, users are able to verify and validate the value of USDX are backed by collateral like Gin 1689 NFTs, and MXC/DHX/Ride tokens.

NFTs and tokens are used as collateral to back the USDX, the collateral rate should be above 120% to make sure the USDX can't be de-pegged from the market fluctuation. Normally the NFTs are issued by companies and manufacturers to let communities to burn USDX and get a collateral to redeem, in the whole reserve of the MXC there are 20 percent of cryptocurrencies as collateral, the rest of 80% should be IoT NFTs that are backed by real-world assets.

The ratio of the 20/80 percent should be adjusted by MXC Reserve, namely MXC DAO in referendum : https://snapshot.org/#/mxcpop.eth

In the following example, it shows how USDX is backed:

| Collateral   | Value USD | Quantity | Total USD | Percentage |
|--------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| M2Pro NFT    | 2700      | 10       | 27000     | 72%        |
| Gin 1689 NFT | 100       | 30       | 3000      | 8%         |
| MXC token    | 1         | 2000     | 2000      | 5.3%       |
| Ride token   | 2         | 100      | 200       | 0.6%       |
| BTC          | 5000      | 1        | 5000      | 13.3%      |
| DHX token    | 100       | 3        | 300       | 0.8%       |
|              |           |          | 37500     | 100%       |

This collateral can create **31,250 USD** with 120% collateral rate. When people want to redeem let's say 200 USD ride token, they will also have to reduce the amount of NFT value according to the 20/80 ratio, otherwise the burning of USDX won't be successful.

In this case, the users will try to redeem one Gin 1689 NFT to get 100USD worth of NFT, and also to get 25USD of any token, like 25USD MXC token. So the user needs to burn 125 USDX, in return he gets 1 Gin 1689 and 25USD MXC

| Collateral redeemed | Value USD | Quantity | Total Burnt USDX | Percentage |
|---------------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Gin 1689 NFT        | 100       | 1        | 100       | 80%        |
| MXC token           | 1         | 25       | 25       | 20%        |
|                     |           |          | 125       | 100%       |
