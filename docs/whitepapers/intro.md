# MXC Whitepapers

MXC (Meta X Connect) founded in 2018 as a non-profit organization, is reshaping the AI and Blockchain industries by collectively building a free and decentralized global data network. 

The MXC Data Network is powered by our robust mining community and the collective power of a vast MXC supporter base, spreading over 170 countries worldwide. Using the world’s only Low-Power Multi-Token Miner (M2 Pro Miner), miners intertwine and build the world’s largest Low-Power Wide-Area Data Network via the Metaverse. MXC has introduced a revolutionary protocol, known as Meta X Protocol or MXProtocol, based upon Proof of Participation mining principles, exploiting LoRaWAN technology to create a global data republic network utilized for real world adoption. This protocol is designed to empower Web 3.0 and a mix of blended reality metaverse infrastructures to simplify and increase data transmissions and participation.

Meta X Connect is a utility token ($MXC), allowing for the increased frequency of data transactions and idiosyncratic data flows within the AI and blockchain markets. The MXProtocol ensures networks are created and connected via a decentralized and robust protocol using an interchain data market, encouraging participation via Proof of Participation “PoP” Mining. The mechanism also allows for the provisioning of any tangible smart Internet of Things (IoT) devices with minimal cost, creating a framework for data providers and receivers to produce their own GDPR-safe AI and blockchain NFTs.

The protocol allows individual network users, corporations, and enterprises to participate in constructing a global decentralized and secured network for their individuals within the MXC platform. 

Device provisioning, tags, sensors, and smart connected devices on the network take advantage of unlimited downlink and uplink resources in the MXC LPWAN data republic with no cost, increasing global LPWAN coverage, allowing any device to access the network to share, to commit or engage with data, creating a unique value on the Blockchain, for Web 3.0, and the Metaverse.
