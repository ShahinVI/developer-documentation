Community should follow the rules when they submit proposals:

** Submit proposal with 2 million MXC**
** Related topics can only be discussed 2 times/6 months frame** 
** Anyone can vote, voters don't need MXC to vote **


The vote doesn't cost any Ethereum gas fee nor your MXC/ETH/BTC, community should submit a Pull Request of the code after the referendum is done.

Any unverified changes from MXC Foundation is welcome as long as the proposal is favoured by community.
